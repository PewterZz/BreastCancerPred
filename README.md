### Abstract
Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer can significantly improve the chances of successful treatment and survival. Therefore, developing accurate and reliable methods for predicting the risk of breast cancer is of great importance. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach for predicting the risk of breast cancer using a dataset obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. The dataset consists of 32 attributes and a binary class label indicating the presence or absence of breast cancer. We evaluate the performance of several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), KNN, random forest, MLPClassifier and K-Means on the dataset. The results of our study show that the SVM algorithm is the most effective for predicting the risk of breast cancer using the dataset. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms for predicting the risk of breast cancer and highlights the importance of early detection and diagnosis in improving the chances of successful treatment and survival.
